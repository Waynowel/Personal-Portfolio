         <h1 class="reflection">Entry1: Comparative Analysis</h1>
         <p style="text-indent: 50px;">I find it to be an incredibly enjoying journey of exploration and understanding the beliefs, rituals, and cultural contexts of various faiths in different parts of the world.

          Comparing religions with Shintoism has not only broadened my knowledge but also challenged my preconceptions and biases. It's nice to recognize the complexity of different religious traditions and to realize that there is no absolute"right" way to approach spirituality and faith.
          
          Through this activity, I've learned to approach each religion with openness and respect, understanding that each offers valuable insights into the human experience. It's fascinating to see the commonalities that run through different faiths, as well as the unique perspectives they bring to existential questions and moral problems.

         <h1 class="reflection">Entry2: Shintoism Report</h1>
         <p style="text-indent: 50px;">This report is tasked to guide us through this semester’s lessons, it is the Shintoism Religion in Japan. This religion is usually heard in anime and not usually taught in schools. Studying this with my group mates improves my brainstorming ability together with communication skills.

          <h1 class="reflection">Entry3: Quizzes</h1>
          <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> These quizzes serve as assessments of my understanding of each religion we've explored in this subject. Through diligent note-taking while listening to the lessons, I've found that I've acquired considerable knowledge. This practice significantly enhances my comprehension of the material. Moreover, I've observed that engaging in quizzes after the lessons assists me in solidifying my understanding of the key concepts pertaining to the religions we've discussed into.</p>

         <h1 class="reflection">Entry1: Social Thinkers Report</h1>
         <p style="text-indent: 50px;">One takeaway from the lessons on social thinkers in the Philippines, as we presented the side of Sir Claro M. Cenizo, it is the recognition of the profound impact that individuals can have on shaping societal perspectives and driving change. Cenizo's perspective likely underscores the importance of critical analysis and activism in addressing social issues within the Philippine. Through his insights, we learners may have learned the significance of engaging with different viewpoints and advocating the youth for meaningful reforms to address the country's socio-economic dillemas.</p>

         <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Group Quiz Bee, an activity that hones your collaborative skills while learning. We are the top scorer in this activity. I could say that our group members are good enough to surpassed the other groups. We prepared ourselves by taking a mock quiz bee conducted by our group leader, by doing this we can lessen the chance of getting the wrong answers. And we also prepared a yell that is also graded. I will link the video below.</p>

          <h1 class="reflection">Entry3: Notes</h1>
          <p style="text-indent: 50px;">These notes serve as my guide through the lessons we've tackled in this subject. They're more than just reminders; that ensuring I stay on track and excel in my studies. I can confidently say that having these notes significantly contributes to achieving my desired grades in this subject.

One aspect of this subject that I particularly enjoy is the emphasis on written output. Every week, I anticipate the opportunity to put write the asssigned notes in that week, knowing that Ms. Galleto will carefully review and stamp my work. Her stamp serves as a tangible symbol of my hard work and dedication, motivating me to continually strive for excellence.
Moreover, beyond just aiding my academic performance, these notes also facilitate deeper learning and understanding of the subject matter. They serve as a well of knowledge, allowing me to review key concepts and enhance my understanding over time.</p>

             <p style="text-indent: 50px;">We are tasked to report the Auditory Imagery, As we deep dive into reports on auditory imagery and other forms of sensory representation, I notice the impact of these experiences on my daily life and cognitive processes. It's fascinating to see how my mind can evoke vivid auditory scenes, transporting me to different places or evoking powerful emotions with just a simple sound. These insights highlight the relationship between my mind and the world around me. It feels like I’ve gained a deeper appreciation for the power of imagination in shaping my perceptions.</p>

             <h1 class="reflection">Entry2: Journal</h1>
             <p style="text-indent: 50px;">This work requires a deep understanding of previous lessons because you need to apply your learnings in composing your weekly entry. Initially, I thought I just needed to recount what we did in that particular week, but that is not the purpose of this journal. The journal also constitutes a significant component of the grading system for the semester. Therefore, I am eager to complete this journal because failing to do so on time might result in failing this subject.</p>

              <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> I believe this project represents the largest undertaking we've faced this year, and it has certainly been a significant journey. This activity has taken us through a range of emotions, akin to a roller coaster ride. Throughout the process of crafting these presentations, we've encountered numerous challenges, yet each obstacle has contributed to our resilience and growth. Reflecting on our past experiences with similar projects, we've been able to persevere and deliver our utmost quality of work. Moreover, our schedule has been exceedingly demanding. Balancing this project with our other classes has proven to be quite the challenge. With multiple subjects vying for our attention this semester, it often feels as though there are not enough hours in the day. Nevertheless, despite the pressure, we've made a concerted effort to arrive at school early, dedicating additional time to perfecting our props and rehearsing for the upcoming performance.</p>

             <p style="text-indent:50px;">Throughout the semester, we take atleast 6 post-quizzes. These quizzes helps me determine how I need to improve or know if I learned something in each every lesson we had. I remember that Ms. Galleto would give plus points if you have participated in a game before the actual lesson and you could use that to support your scores in these quizzes. Not missing a single quiz helps me gain a hefty amount of grades in this subject. </p>

              <p style="text-indent: 50px;">This is the final requirement to pass this subject, and it marks one of the biggest projects our section has undertaken. As a member of the props department, my responsibility is to ensure that each scene looks immersive and natural, thereby enhancing the overall production quality. Additionally, I often find myself stepping in as an extra due to our production's chronic understaffing, a common occurrence in our journey.

Despite our challenges, such as working late and facing reprimands for it, we've remained resilient, learning from our mistakes and cherishing the journey because we may never experience it again with them. Our dedication culminated in the film's screening at Rm. 401 on April 18, 2023. Throughout this project, we forged bonds as strong as titanium steel, propelling us forward as a unified team.</p>

             <p style="text-indent: 50px;">This report help us to think critically about the interconnection of these two subjects. I've come to realize that history plays a crucial role in politics, and it saddens me that we continue to overlook the lessons of the past. Examining these two subjects highlights the importance of considering history before engaging in politics. By examing in depth  of the historical contexts, we gain valuable insights into the complexities and dynamics of political systems.</p>

Reciting the preamble not only allows me to hold its significance but also serves as a motivational reminder of the role of the constitution in our society. It acts as a concise overview of the constitution's content, guiding its principles and values. However, despite my aspirations , I find myself hindered by my current skill level, particularly in the area of memorization.</p>
